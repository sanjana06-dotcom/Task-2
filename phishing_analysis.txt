Phishing Email Analysis – Task 2

Email Source: PayPal phishing example

Indicators found:
1. Sender address spoofing – Display name shows service@intl.paypal.com but real sending address is service.epaypal@outlook.com.
2. Urgent subject line – “Response required” designed to create panic.
3. Unusual activity warning – Fake security alert to push user to click.
4. Suspicious links – "log in" and "Resolution Center" could lead to fake sites (hover to check real URL).
5. Generic greeting – No personal name, just "Dear Customer".
6. Language issues – Minor grammatical inconsistencies.
7. From domain does not match official PayPal domain (paypal.com).

Risks:
- Credential theft via fake login page.
- Possible malware if links lead to malicious downloads.

Recommendations:
- Do not click links or download attachments from suspicious emails.
- Report to PayPal's phishing email address: phishing@paypal.com.
- Delete the email after reporting.
